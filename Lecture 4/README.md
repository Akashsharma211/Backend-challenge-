1. I learned about mongodb.
Cluster: A MongoDB cluster is a group of interconnected servers (nodes) that work together to store, manage, and distribute data across multiple machines.  Clusters provide high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance, allowing MongoDB to handle large datasets and high traffic loads beyond the limits of a single server. 
2. Types of server:
Web Server – Hosts websites (e.g., Apache HTTP Server, Nginx)

Application Server – Runs backend logic (e.g., Apache Tomcat)

Database Server – Stores data (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)

File Server – Shares files in a network

Mail Server – Sends/receives emails

DNS Server – Converts domain name to IP

Proxy Server – Acts as a middleman for security

Cloud Server – Hosted on cloud (e.g., Amazon Web Services)

3. Mainly 4 operations are there in database:
CRUD
C=> Create
R=> Read
U=> Update
D=> Delete



mongodb+srv:/yt:<db_password>@yt-complete-backend.v3jfyw5.mongodb.net/

0.0.0.0/0 => is used for access for anywhere.

4. "npm i mongoose" for installing mongoose and this is used for connecting server to database

5. db folder=> is used for databse folder
6. models folder=> used for making schema
